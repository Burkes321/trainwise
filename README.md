- ability for user to add their own custom exerises
- list of built in exercises for the user to choose from
- list of exercises on the "exercises page" is filterable / searchable

## run this project locally

first set up your environmetn for react native development

[React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

project was bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)

- clone the project from github
- run `npm install` to install dependencies
- run `npm run start` to begin the metro bundler
- once metro bundler is running, press 'a' in the terminal window where it is running to run on android. Project is not developed with iOS in mind.
